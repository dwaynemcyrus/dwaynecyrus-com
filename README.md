# Dwayne M Cyrus — AI Design Engineer
**Building Systems That Think, Interfaces That Feel, and Tools That Free.**
I design and engineer human-centered systems where code, intelligence, and discipline converge into clarity.

---

## Mission Statement
This portfolio is the living record of my evolution into an **AI Design Engineer** — a creator who merges design, engineering, and intelligence into cohesive digital systems.  
It is not a showcase of static projects, but a demonstration of synthesis: how interfaces, data, and human experience can converge into clarity, precision, and sovereignty.  
Every project here reflects a single intent — to engineer tools that make people more aware, more focused, and more free.

## Core Objectives
1. **Establish AI Design Engineering Mastery** — build a portfolio that unites interface craft, data systems, and applied AI.  
2. **Demonstrate Hire-Ready Competence** — position for frontend, AI-integrated, or design-engineering roles in Switzerland’s tech and life-science sectors.  
3. **Document Integration of Art, Logic, and Intelligence** — each project acts as a proof of synthesis between creativity and computation.

## AI Design Engineering Philosophy
> “Design engineers don’t just build — they orchestrate intelligence.”

The modern AI Design Engineer is not a specialist.  
He is a systems thinker who:
- Designs with empathy and precision  
- Engineers for performance, adaptability, and modularity  
- Integrates AI as an augmentation layer, not a spectacle  
- Builds tools that think *with* the user, not *for* them  

My philosophy is **Human-First, Machine-Enhanced**:  
create environments where intelligence amplifies focus and meaning.

## Tech Stack
| Layer | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Framework | **Astro (v5+)** — static + hybrid rendering for performance and MDX integration |
| Components | React + Astro Islands architecture |
| Styling | Vanilla CSS (learning base), later Tailwind CSS for scalability |
| Data | IndexedDB / SQLite (local-first), MongoDB / CloudKit (sync layers) |
| AI Integration | Local LLMs via MLX (Apple Silicon), OpenAI API for prototyping |
| Design | Figma / Framer / Procreate / Nomad Sculpt |
| Deployment | Vercel / Netlify |
| Knowledge System | Markdown / Obsidian / Zettelkasten |

## Development Workflow
1. Initialize Astro project  
2. Create `/src/content/projects` entries for each new build  
3. Build and deploy incrementally to Vercel  
4. Document progress in Obsidian under `Vault/Projects/Portfolio/`  
5. Commit using Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`)  
6. Integrate AI experiments using local inference or API-driven prototypes

## Closing Statement
> *The AI Design Engineer is not defined by tools, but by orchestration — of systems, intelligence, and self-discipline. This portfolio is the forge where those three meet.*
